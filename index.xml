Allegations of human error and a strongly-worded denial of responsibility from the white house have led to a collapse in US Livonian relations as well as a cancellation of the exercise themselves, creating a logistical nightmare and leaving 11,000 overseas personnel stranded.</description></item><item><title>Joint Russian-CSAT Exercise in Kaliningrad Heightens Tensions in Europe</title><link>https://aan-news.proffer.dev/articles/joint-russian-csat-exercises/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 10:57:22 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://aan-news.proffer.dev/articles/joint-russian-csat-exercises/</guid><description>CSAT troops take part in Russia joint military exercises led by the armed forces of Russia, CSAT’s defense ministry said on Wednesday.
