Only recently they&amp;rsquo;ve found out that small village in Anizay is their main staging point for smuggled goods. In cooperation with Anizay police, $400,000 worth of cigarettes were recovered during the raid on unexpecting smugglers.
They&amp;rsquo;re awaiting extradition to Takistan in the capital of Anizay. However, it&amp;rsquo;s very likely that Anizay will want to punish them too as it&amp;rsquo;s estimated they avoided around $200,000 customs fee.</description></item><item><title>Coalition Forces Respond to UN Plea</title><link>https://3Mydlo3.github.io/aan-world-news/articles/other/coalition-forces-respond-to-un/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 May 2020 18:11:26 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://3Mydlo3.github.io/aan-world-news/articles/other/coalition-forces-respond-to-un/</guid><description>A U.S. Marine provides covering fire with a heavy machine gun.

On 04/16/2020, a local news affiliate reported the capture and subsequent ransom request for eight Afghan National Police being held by a Iranian-backed terrorist cell.
While the U.S. Department of Defense denies any responsibility for the rescue of the eight Afghan National Police, a unnamed credible source reported several U.S. Army aircraft departing Taji Air Base, Iraq earlier that morning. With the recent news of the infamous Blackwater private military contracting group being awarded funding for operational status in the region BBN can&amp;rsquo;t help but question the coincidence.</description></item><item><title>NATO Forces Assist in Anizay</title><link>https://3Mydlo3.github.io/aan-world-news/articles/other/us-military-assists-in-anizay/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Mar 2020 22:38:50 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://3Mydlo3.github.io/aan-world-news/articles/other/us-military-assists-in-anizay/</guid><description>A NATO soldier provides overwatch in Landay.

As the Islamic State poured into the northern regions of Anizay this past Friday, military forces and government backed militias were overwhelmed. With the capital and nearby cities under siege, civilians fled to the southern borders in an attempt to get out of the country.
A rapid response force, consisting of nearly 500 US soldiers and sailors, have arrived to defend the diplomatic embassy in Landay.</description></item></channel></rss>
