Only recently they&amp;rsquo;ve found out that small village in Anizay is their main staging point for smuggled goods. In cooperation with Anizay police, $400,000 worth of cigarettes were recovered during the raid on unexpecting smugglers.
They&amp;rsquo;re awaiting extradition to Takistan in the capital of Anizay. However, it&amp;rsquo;s very likely that Anizay will want to punish them too as it&amp;rsquo;s estimated they avoided around $200,000 customs fee.</description></item></channel></rss>
