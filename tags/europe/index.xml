Tensions in the Baltics are getting worse day by day, as Russian forces start to reach the border with Estonia, &amp;ldquo;fortifying their positions&amp;rdquo;. This is what the correspondent of the Russian Brigade in the area, Colonel Fyodor Vladimirovich Beketov said to AAN News, stating that &amp;ldquo;NATO is moving a lot of troops near our borders, especially near Kaliningrad. We have also decided to move a mechanized brigade as a response to such actions, also to prevent any kind of unwanted actions from our western neighbours.</description></item><item><title>Enquiry Fails to Find Cause of Livonian Training Disaster</title><link>https://3Mydlo3.github.io/aan-world-news/articles/other/livonian-training-disaster/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 11:06:45 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://3Mydlo3.github.io/aan-world-news/articles/other/livonian-training-disaster/</guid><description>A US board of inquiry has said it is &amp;ldquo;very unlikely&amp;rdquo; Russian provocateurs were behind the June 19 training accident in Livonia. The incident occurred when a Greyhawk UAV overshot its target and dropped a GPS-guided bomb on a military site, claiming the lives of 1 American and 7 Livonia. Allegations of human error and a strongly-worded denial of responsibility from the white house have led to a collapse in US Livonian relations as well as a cancellation of the exercise themselves, creating a logistical nightmare and leaving 11,000 overseas personnel stranded.</description></item><item><title>Joint Russian-CSAT Exercise in Kaliningrad Heightens Tensions in Europe</title><link>https://3Mydlo3.github.io/aan-world-news/articles/other/joint-russian-csat-exercises/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 10:57:22 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://3Mydlo3.github.io/aan-world-news/articles/other/joint-russian-csat-exercises/</guid><description>CSAT troops take part in Russia joint military exercises led by the armed forces of Russia, CSAT’s defense ministry said on Wednesday.
