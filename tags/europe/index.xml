The incident occurred when a Greyhawk UAV overshot its target and dropped a GPS-guided bomb on a military site, claiming the lives of 1 American and 7 Livonia. Allegations of human error and a strongly-worded denial of responsibility from the white house have led to a collapse in US Livonian relations as well as a cancellation of the exercise themselves, creating a logistical nightmare and leaving 11,000 overseas personnel stranded.</description></item><item><title>Joint Russian-CSAT Exercise in Kaliningrad Heightens Tensions in Europe</title><link>https://3Mydlo3.github.io/aan-world-news/articles/other/joint-russian-csat-exercises/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 10:57:22 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://3Mydlo3.github.io/aan-world-news/articles/other/joint-russian-csat-exercises/</guid><description>CSAT troops take part in Russia joint military exercises led by the armed forces of Russia, CSAT’s defense ministry said on Wednesday.

Before the match, Czechia fans were quite optimistic. Rival was definitely in range for a hard earned win. Czechs gained an advantage very early in the first period and the crowd at Prague arena went crazy. That gave Russians some anger they needed to recover and bully Czechs 1-3 till the end of the first period.</description></item><item><title>NATO Statement on coup in Chernarus</title><link>https://3Mydlo3.github.io/aan-world-news/articles/europe/2021/05/nato-statement-on-chernarus-coup/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 May 2021 20:21:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://3Mydlo3.github.io/aan-world-news/articles/europe/2021/05/nato-statement-on-chernarus-coup/</guid><description>Following today&amp;rsquo;s coup in Chernarus and Russian Forces entering Chernarus, NATO General Secretary called a press conference at 8 PM.
