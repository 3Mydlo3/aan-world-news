Tensions in the Baltics are getting worse day by day, as Russian forces start to reach the border with Estonia, &amp;ldquo;fortifying their positions&amp;rdquo;.

We have also decided to move a mechanized brigade as a response to such actions, also to prevent any kind of unwanted actions from our western neighbours.</description></item><item><title>Enquiry Fails to Find Cause of Livonian Training Disaster</title><link>https://3Mydlo3.github.io/aan-world-news/articles/other/livonian-training-disaster/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 11:06:45 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://3Mydlo3.github.io/aan-world-news/articles/other/livonian-training-disaster/</guid><description>A US board of inquiry has said it is &amp;ldquo;very unlikely&amp;rdquo; Russian provocateurs were behind the June 19 training accident in Livonia. The incident occurred when a Greyhawk UAV overshot its target and dropped a GPS-guided bomb on a military site, claiming the lives of 1 American and 7 Livonia. Allegations of human error and a strongly-worded denial of responsibility from the white house have led to a collapse in US Livonian relations as well as a cancellation of the exercise themselves, creating a logistical nightmare and leaving 11,000 overseas personnel stranded.</description></item><item><title>Joint Russian-CSAT Exercise in Kaliningrad Heightens Tensions in Europe</title><link>https://3Mydlo3.github.io/aan-world-news/articles/other/joint-russian-csat-exercises/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 10:57:22 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://3Mydlo3.github.io/aan-world-news/articles/other/joint-russian-csat-exercises/</guid><description>CSAT troops take part in Russia joint military exercises led by the armed forces of Russia, CSAT’s defense ministry said on Wednesday.

Before the match, Czechia fans were quite optimistic. Rival was definitely in range for a hard earned win. Czechs gained an advantage very early in the first period and the crowd at Prague arena went crazy. That gave Russians some anger they needed to recover and bully Czechs 1-3 till the end of the first period.</description></item><item><title>Shootout in Berezino, dozens killed</title><link>https://3Mydlo3.github.io/aan-world-news/articles/chernarus/2021/04/berezino-chedaks-militia-shootout/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2021 09:23:16 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://3Mydlo3.github.io/aan-world-news/articles/chernarus/2021/04/berezino-chedaks-militia-shootout/</guid><description>Militia secures the scene.
