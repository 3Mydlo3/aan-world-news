He was too shocked and initially refused to surrender, then dropped his weapons and tried to escape, but was wounded and captured. After that, a base guard refused him medical help and the poor soldier bled out, witnessed by other arrested men from his unit.\nBase commander refuses any comments on the matter.\n","image":"overturned-btr-zelenogorsk.jpg","description":"Overturned BTR on the street, one dead soldier, trucks stolen; summary of the military train brawl at Zelenogorsk base","wordCount":294,"datePublished":"2022-03-15T20:57:51+02:00","dateModified":"2022-03-15T20:57:51+02:00","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Daniel Spadel"}]}</script></main><footer class=site-footer><div class="container container--wide"><div class=site-footer__logo><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 192.63 52"><title>AAN World News</title><desc>AAN World News spelt out with san-serif letters.</desc><path fill="#430b0c" d="M104.3.0h88.33v52H104.3z"/><path d="M20.55 5.06l12.74 41.8h-7.78l-2.57-9.31H10.2L7.53 46.9H0L12.87 5.06zm.43 25.64-4.29-15.3h-.06l-4.47 15.34z" fill="#fff"/><path d="M53.22 5.06l12.74 41.8h-7.78l-2.55-9.27H42.87L40.2 46.9h-7.57L45.54 5.06zm.41 25.68L49.36 15.4h-.1l-4.43 15.34zM76.35 5.06l14.22 28h.06v-28h7v41.8h-7.45l-14.16-28h-.1v28h-7V5.06zm37.36.73 2 9.89.45 2.75.45-2.7 1.75-9.94h3.41l1.86 9.89.47 2.75.48-2.65 2.07-10h3.29l-4.31 17.28h-3.1l-1.9-10.1-.54-3.34-.55 3.34-1.91 10.1h-3l-4.4-17.27zm28.84 15.73a7.39 7.39.0 01-10.15.0c-1.57-1.64-2.35-4-2.35-7.12s.78-5.54 2.35-7.13a7.41 7.41.0 0110.15.0q2.34 2.39 2.34 7.13c0 3.1-.78 5.48-2.34 7.12zm-2-2.62a7.67 7.67.0 001.13-4.5 7.65 7.65.0 00-1.13-4.49 3.75 3.75.0 00-6.12.0 7.52 7.52.0 00-1.15 4.5 7.52 7.52.0 001.15 4.5 3.75 3.75.0 006.12.0zM156 6.23a4 4 0 011.45 1.21 5.75 5.75.0 01.77 1.45 5.15 5.15.0 01.29 1.82 5.52 5.52.0 01-.56 2.42 3.22 3.22.0 01-1.83 1.68 3 3 0 011.51 1.37 6.21 6.21.0 01.45 2.7v1.18a9.14 9.14.0 00.09 1.6 1.44 1.44.0 00.59 1v.4h-3.57q-.15-.57-.21-.93a10.31 10.31.0 01-.14-1.48v-1.61a3.48 3.48.0 00-.51-2.2 2.41 2.41.0 00-1.84-.55h-3.16v6.77h-3.17V5.79h7.41a6.2 6.2.0 012.43.44zm-6.69 2.56v4.64h3.48a3.5 3.5.0 001.56-.28 2 2 0 00.91-1.95 2.27 2.27.0 00-.88-2.14 3 3 0 00-1.5-.3zm11.01-3h3.24v14.16h7.73v3.11h-11zm20.93.37a5.24 5.24.0 012.64 2.19 8 8 0 011.1 2.79 14.65 14.65.0 01.3 2.86 12.67 12.67.0 01-1.24 5.84 5.52 5.52.0 01-5.2 3.22h-6.68V5.79h6.68a7.38 7.38.0 012.4.37zm-5.93 2.63v11.27h3a3.27 3.27.0 003.2-2.52 9.77 9.77.0 00.5-3.29 9 9 0 00-.74-4 3 3 0 00-3-1.41zM111.55 29.63h3.39l6.15 12v-12h3V46.9h-3.24l-6.3-12.26V46.9h-3zm25.76 3.05h-8.2v3.67h7.52v3h-7.52v4.44h8.57v3.11h-11.73V29.63h11.36zM141.02 29.63l2.05 9.89.44 2.75.45-2.7 1.75-9.94h3.41l1.84 9.89.47 2.75.48-2.65 2.07-10h3.29l-4.36 17.27h-3.09l-1.87-10.1-.55-3.34-.55 3.34-1.87 10.1h-3l-4.35-17.26zm19.25 11.94a3.67 3.67.0 00.59 1.77 3.22 3.22.0 002.77 1.06 5.29 5.29.0 001.9-.28 2 2 0 001.39-2 1.54 1.54.0 00-.68-1.33 7.11 7.11.0 00-2.15-.81l-1.68-.41a9.49 9.49.0 01-3.39-1.32 4.39 4.39.0 01-1.57-3.74 5.23 5.23.0 011.53-3.85 6.06 6.06.0 014.5-1.54 6.41 6.41.0 014.23 1.45 5.32 5.32.0 011.83 4.2h-3.11a2.47 2.47.0 00-1.25-2.21 3.84 3.84.0 00-1.92-.44 3.41 3.41.0 00-2.05.56 1.85 1.85.0 00-.77 1.57 1.53 1.53.0 00.76 1.39 8.7 8.7.0 002.06.71l2.71.72a6.5 6.5.0 012.66 1.25 4.43 4.43.0 011.39 3.53 5.21 5.21.0 01-1.64 3.93 6.48 6.48.0 01-4.64 1.56 7 7 0 01-4.81-1.54 5.33 5.33.0 01-1.75-4.23z" fill="#fff"/></svg></div><nav class="navigation navigation--primary" aria-label=secondary><ul class=unstyled-list><li><a class=no-underline href=https://armaforces.github.io/aan-world-news/tags/chernarus/>Chernarus</a></li><li><a class=no-underline href=https://armaforces.github.io/aan-world-news/tags/europe/>Europe</a></li><li><a class=no-underline href=https://armaforces.github.io/aan-world-news/tags/middle-east/>Middle East</a></li></ul></nav></div></footer><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vanilla-lazyload@13.0.1/dist/lazyload.min.js></script>
