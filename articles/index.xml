Reckless chase through central Chernarus I was going back home when a reckless pickup swinged by me in Chernogorsk, immediately followed by 2 Militia cars with sirens on. Without any thought, I turned around and joined the chase, hoping to get some good photos.
The suspect was heading north through Nadiezdino and Rogowo towards Kabanino.</description></item><item><title>Russian Forces leave Chernarus</title><link>https://3Mydlo3.github.io/aan-world-news/articles/chernarus/2022/01/russian-forces-leave-chernarus/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://3Mydlo3.github.io/aan-world-news/articles/chernarus/2022/01/russian-forces-leave-chernarus/</guid><description>TODO: Add image of Russian vehicles at Chernarus checkpoint Today Russian Forces left Chernarus entirely.
This is the result of talks between Chedaks and Russians, which were ongoing in December. On 27th December, Russians have agreed their Armed Forces to leave Chernarus. However, there will still be some civilian personnel remaining for undisclosed period of time, including government advisors.

Only recently they&amp;rsquo;ve found out that small village in Anizay is their main staging point for smuggled goods. In cooperation with Anizay police, $400,000 worth of cigarettes were recovered during the raid on unexpecting smugglers.
They&amp;rsquo;re awaiting extradition to Takistan in the capital of Anizay. However, it&amp;rsquo;s very likely that Anizay will want to punish them too as it&amp;rsquo;s estimated they avoided around $200,000 customs fee.</description></item><item><title>Anti-Chedaki protests in Chernogorsk</title><link>https://3Mydlo3.github.io/aan-world-news/articles/chernarus/2021/06/anti-chedaki-protests-in-chernogorsk/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jun 2021 19:17:25 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://3Mydlo3.github.io/aan-world-news/articles/chernarus/2021/06/anti-chedaki-protests-in-chernogorsk/</guid><description>Dissatisfaction of Chernarus citizens grows Since Chedaks took power in Chernarus, discontent among the population grew instead of decaying. One could wonder why are they still unhappy if the government changed. And they are even more unhappy than ever before.
Today over 500 people joined protest in Chernogorsk while government sources said there was a small protest of 30 citizens. As far as we&amp;rsquo;ve managed to discover, there were even citizens of Zelenogorsk and Severograd on the protest.</description></item><item><title>Czechia beats Russia in ice hockey</title><link>https://3Mydlo3.github.io/aan-world-news/articles/europe/2021/05/czechia-russia-ice-hockey-5-4/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 May 2021 22:34:02 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://3Mydlo3.github.io/aan-world-news/articles/europe/2021/05/czechia-russia-ice-hockey-5-4/</guid><description>Optimism, disappointment, lack of faith in making up for losses and incredible joy after an unbelievable win are just few of the vast range of emotions that Czech players gave their fans tonight.
