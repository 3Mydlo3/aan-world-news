Only recently they&amp;rsquo;ve found out that small village in Anizay is their main staging point for smuggled goods. In cooperation with Anizay police, $400,000 worth of cigarettes were recovered during the raid on unexpecting smugglers.
They&amp;rsquo;re awaiting extradition to Takistan in the capital of Anizay. However, it&amp;rsquo;s very likely that Anizay will want to punish them too as it&amp;rsquo;s estimated they avoided around $200,000 customs fee.</description></item><item><title>Enquiry Fails to Find Cause of Livonian Training Disaster</title><link>https://3Mydlo3.github.io/aan-world-news/articles/other/livonian-training-disaster/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 11:06:45 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://3Mydlo3.github.io/aan-world-news/articles/other/livonian-training-disaster/</guid><description>A US board of inquiry has said it is &amp;ldquo;very unlikely&amp;rdquo; Russian provocateurs were behind the June 19 training accident in Livonia.

Allegations of human error and a strongly-worded denial of responsibility from the white house have led to a collapse in US Livonian relations as well as a cancellation of the exercise themselves, creating a logistical nightmare and leaving 11,000 overseas personnel stranded.</description></item><item><title>Joint Russian-CSAT Exercise in Kaliningrad Heightens Tensions in Europe</title><link>https://3Mydlo3.github.io/aan-world-news/articles/other/joint-russian-csat-exercises/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 10:57:22 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://3Mydlo3.github.io/aan-world-news/articles/other/joint-russian-csat-exercises/</guid><description>CSAT troops take part in Russia joint military exercises led by the armed forces of Russia, CSAT’s defense ministry said on Wednesday.
