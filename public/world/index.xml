(AAN World News)
Some 25,000 Livonian, US, and British troops are participating in joint training operations, less than 15 km from the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.
Named Exercise Electron-39, the event will be the biggest of its kind and comes just weeks ahead of a Kremlin decision on a CSAT membership action plan.
Russia says that such a show of force, close to its borders, is a threat to its security.</description></item></channel></rss>
