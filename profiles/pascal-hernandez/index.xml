There are numerous reports of fighter jets flying in and out throughout the Malden Islands. Citizens report fighting and explosions on the ground as well. Confirmed reports by the US Department of Defense confirm that they have deployed a Marine Expeditionary Force to combat an army intent on taking the Malden Islands. The last time this has ever happened was during the Cold War when US involvement led to the detonation of nuclear weaponry on the island of Everon.</description></item></channel></rss>
