(BBN Global)
Tensions in the Baltics are getting worse day by day, as Russian forces start to reach the border with Estonia, &amp;ldquo;fortifying their positions&amp;rdquo;. This is what the correspondent of the Russian Brigade in the area, Colonel Fyodor Vladimirovich Beketov said to AAN News, stating that &amp;ldquo;NATO is moving a lot of troops near our borders, especially near Kaliningrad. We have also decided to move a mechanized brigade as a response to such actions, also to prevent any kind of unwanted actions from our western neighbours.</description></item></channel></rss>
