### Workers demand better pay and work conditions

Tensions in Chernogorsk's stink factory grew for a last couple of days. Workers were unhappy about their pay and work conditions, arguing that they should have additional healthcare days off. Additionally, their pay should grow at least 10% due to, in their opinion, exceptional performance and stink production rates last year.

Factory's Management however, kept ignoring all signs of an incoming spontaneous and out of nothing rebellion. They told workers that they've indeed produced record high stink amounts, but predictions for this year show much lower demand for stink.

Today workers decided for an all-out strike and immediately after coming to the factory at 6 AM, they've refused working and blocked all entrances to the factory. After an hour, one of the factory managers came to calm down workers. This failed and he called for the rest of the management board to come to the factory and negotiate with workers. In the meantime Militia surrounded the factory entrances and kept order, without direct involvement.

As of writing this article, the situation is still open and the negotiations should start soon.

### Update 4 PM: Factory's management agreed to pay a bonus to each worker to end the strike immediately

Although newly formed union would definitely want more, they are happy they've received additional pay instead of Militia's batons.
