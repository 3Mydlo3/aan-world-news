Today at 7 AM, heavy shootout occurred in the outskirts of Berezino. Militia squad supported by few local farmers were heading for last known location of Chedaki fighters. They were ambushed in the forest 1 km west of Berezino. Shots were heard in the city as well as in surrounding villages.

Heavy fighting lasted almost an hour. Despite suffering severe losses in the first minutes of firefight, Militia and farmers slowly retreated towards forest edge using remaining vehicle as cover and held their ground waiting for reinforcements. First some additional patrols from Berezino Militia arrived with additional weaponry and ammunition, as the firefight in the forest was very intense and consumed a lot of ammunition. However, the main reinforcements from Elektrozavodsk were delayed. When they finally arrived on scene, most Militia men were either killed or wounded, some survivors in the forest were taken captive. However, Chedaks quickly recognized Militia's advantage when cavalry arrived. They fled, leaving any survivors behind.

One of Militia survivors told that Chedaks were "inappropriately well equipped" for a rogue militia and they even used explosives like hand grenades. Brief analysis of the scene confirmed his words. This is the first time use of hand grenades and RPGs by Chedaks has been spotted, although it was presumed earlier they might have access to more than just small arms.

As of now, there are 4 killed Militia officers, 6 wounded and 3 are missing, including commander Igel who was responsible for the operation. Out of 6 involved farmers, 3 were killed and 2 are severly wounded. 2 killed Chedaks were found, with 2 heavily wounded found. These numbers might change in the following hours as status of 6 wounded is critical and public services didn't manage to search the surrounding area yet. Critically wounded were taken to hospitals in Novodimitrovsk, Severograd and Chernogorsk by helicopters.

Minister of Internal Security issued a statement denouncing the blodshed and demanded Chedaks to start the armistice negotiations straight away. He had also expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised decorations for brave men who have fallen during the clash. Asked about missing Militia men, he expressed his will to find them and that he's open to negotiate their safe return from captivity if alive.

_Update 1 PM: One Chedaki fighter, a Militia men and a farmer passed away from the extent of the injury. This brings total Militia and farmers casualties to 9 killed, 4 wounded, 3 missing._
