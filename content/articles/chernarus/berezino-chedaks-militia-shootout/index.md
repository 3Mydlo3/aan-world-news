Today at 7 AM, heavy shootout occurred in the outskirts of Berezino. Militia convoy heading for last known location of Chedaki fighters was ambushed in the forest 2 km west of Berezino. Shots were heard in the city as well as in surrounding villages.

Heavy fighting lasted almost an hour. Despite suffering severe losses in the first minutes of firefight, Militia slowly retreated towards forest edge using remaining vehicles as cover and held their ground waiting for reinforcements. First some additional units from Berezino Militia arrived with additional weaponry and ammunition, as the firefight in the forest was very intense and consumed a lot of ammunition. However, the main reinforcements from Elektrozavodsk were delayed. When they finally arrived on scene, most Militia men were killed, some survivors in the forest were taken captive. Chedaks quickly recognized enemy advantage and retreated, leaving any survivors behind.

One of Militia survivors told that Chedaks were "inappropriately well equipped" for a rogue militia and they even used explosives like hand grenades. Brief analysis of the scene confirmed his words. This is the first time use of hand grenades and RPGs by Chedaks has been spotted, although it was presumed earlier they might have access to more than just small arms.

As of now, there are 24 killed Militia officers, 20 wounded and 14 are missing, including commander Igel. 14 killed Chedaks were found, with only 3 heavily wounded found. These numbers might change in the following hours as status of 12 wounded is critical and public services didn't manage to search the surrounding area yet. Critically wounded were taken to hospitals in Novodimitrovsk, Severograd and Chernogorsk by helicopters.

_Update 1 PM: One Chedaki fighter and two militia men passed away from the extent of the injury. This brings total Militia casualties to 26 killed, 18 wounded, 14 missing._
