### Military train came from Russia

Over a dozen cargo wagons and several for carrying vehicle arrived in Zelenogorsk today morning. The train drove through Chernarus at night to avoid disruption in local transport.

Russia claims the transport contains uniforms, helmets, vests, AKs and other personal weapons, ammunition, fragmentation, smoke and stun grenades as well as a bunch of explosives, as there is a shortage of these in Chedaki forces.

### Chedaki leader thanks Russia for additional equipment

Serafim Smirnov thanked Russia for their constant support and friendliness. He said transports from Russia are crucial to keeping Chernarus safe.
