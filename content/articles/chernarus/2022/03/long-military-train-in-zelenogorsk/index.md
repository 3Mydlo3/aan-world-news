### Military train came from Russia

Over dozen equipment wagons and several vehicle ones arrived in Zelenogorsk today's morning. Train drove through Chernarus at night to avoid disruption in local transport.

Russia claims transport contains uniforms, helmets, vests, AKs and other personal weapons, ammunition, fragmentation, smoke and stun grenades and bunch of explosives as there is shortage of these in Chedaki forces.

### Chedaki leader thanks Russia for additional equipment

Serafim Smirnov thanked Russia for constant support and friendliness. He said transports from Russia are crucial to keeping Chernarus safe.
