### All they had to do was unload the damn train

Over a dozen cargo wagons and several for carrying vehicle arrived in Zelenogorsk today morning. Throughout the day, base crew managed to unload only half of the equipment that arrived. Chedaki command ordered other units to send some men to help with unloading the train.

However, upon reaching base, external soldiers were treated like thieves, not like soldiers. Base crew instead of helping them unload the cargo, guarded the train and the cargo. They were very restrictive, didn't even allow fellow fighters to go for a piss. And all of that while holding their guns ready.

Thankfully we've managed to contact one of the soldiers that took part in unloading the train. "We just had to help them, I didn't sign for any of that. We were treated worse than animals, constanly abused as if we were some scum. I was held at gunpoint at least 4 times. That was harrowing" says forcibly conscripted farmer from Pogorevka.

### That went for too long for one of the soldiers

Janusz Bambaryla, one of the soldiers that came to help with unloading the cargo, was treated very badly by base crew. At some point, he just run, stole BTR and tried to escape. Base guards and commander managed to catch him just 200 meters from base. He was too shocked and initially refused to surrender. He dropped his weapons and tried to escape, got shot and captured. After that, base guard refused him medical help and he bleed out, witnessed by other arrested men from his unit.

Base commander refuses any comments on the matter.
