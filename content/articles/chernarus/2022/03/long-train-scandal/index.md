### All they had to do was unload the damn train

Over a dozen cargo wagons and several for carrying vehicles arrived in Zelenogorsk today morning. Throughout the day, the base crew managed to unload only half of the arrived equipment. Chedaki command ordered other units to send some men to help with unloading the train.

However, upon reaching the base, the helpers were treated like thieves, not like soldiers. The base crew guarded the train and the cargo instead of helping the rest. They were very restrictive, didn't even allow fellow fighters to go for a piss. And all of that while holding their guns at the ready.

Thankfully, we've managed to contact one of the soldiers that took part in unloading the train. "We just had to help them, I didn't sign for any of that. They treated us worse than animals, constanly abused as if we were some scum. I was held at gunpoint at least 4 times. That was harrowing" says a forcibly conscripted farmer from Pogorevka.

### That went for too long for one of the soldiers

Janusz Bambaryla, one of the soldiers that came to help, was constantly mistreated by the commanders. At some point, he just ran, stole a BTR and tried to escape. Base guards and the commander managed to catch him just 200 meters outside the base. He was too shocked and initially refused to surrender, then dropped his weapons and tried to escape, but was wounded and captured. After that, a base guard refused him medical help and the poor soldier bled out, witnessed by other arrested men from his unit.

Base commander refuses any comments on the matter.
