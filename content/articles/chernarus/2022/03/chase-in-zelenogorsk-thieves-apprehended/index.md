### Reckless chase through central Chernarus

I was going back home when a reckless pickup swinged by me in Chernogorsk, immediately followed by 2 Militia cars with sirens on. Without any thought, I turned around and joined the chase, hoping to get some good photos.

The suspect was heading north through Nadiezdino and Rogowo towards Kabanino. Upon reaching the village, he spotted Zelenogorsk's Militia van blocking the road to Stary Sobor and turned left just in front of it, towards Wybor. Took left again in Vybor and flew through Pustoshka, barely making the turn at the end of the town.

Their luck ended upon reaching Sosnowka. Going downhill, pickup probably broke the speed limit thrice. There was a Militia car heading towards them from Zelenogorsk. They probably wanted to outturn the head-on Militia and turned too sharp. That caused the truck to flip. It did not even rolled over one time before ending the chase on a nearby tree.

### Suspects apprehended, they had illegal weapons and money

Militia quickly surrounded the pickup. Two bullies surrendered straight away, intimidated by all guns pointed at them. Last one thought he was not going to jail and tried to escape on foot. Three officers and a helicopter went after injured bully and caught him after a minute.

In the meantime, Militia managed to retrieved some briefcase from suspect's car and arrest them for theft and robbery. They've also found several AKs in the trunk of the pickup.

Robbers and their loot were taken to Zelenogorsk's Militia station. They will be transported to Chernogorsk Main Militia station tomorrow morning.
