### That was supposed to be an ordinary day in Zelenogorsk

Almost third day in a row we have a sensation in Zelenogorsk. After [scandal at Zelenogorsk](/articles/chernarus/2022/03/long-train-scandal) base 3 days ago and a [reckless pursuit](/articles/chernarus/2022/03/chase-in-zelenogorsk-thieves-apprehended) yesterday, there was another criminal event in Zelenogorsk. This time the Militia station was robbed, shortly before apperhended bandits were supposed to be transported to Chernogorsk.

Apart from released bandits, two boxes with weapons and a briefcase with money is also missing from the station. The search for bandits, after unfruitful hour of intensive search, has been put on hold so far, until Chedaki Army can help.

### Militia shoots the robbers without warning, escalating the robbery to a shooting

We've managed to get a quick interview with one of the Militia men that was at the station during the heist.

- "Seconds before they've breached back doors, I've left the station to turn off the engine of a crashed Militia car just outside the station. It was still pretty dark. When walking to the car I thought I saw some movement on the station's parking, but I ignored that. Seconds after I turned off the engine, I heard something like an explosion. Initially, I thought it's just another accident, but then my partner didn't respond on the radio. I went to the back door and saw it was blown off. I've reached for my gun and walked slowly towards the door. I spotted a bastard casually leaving the station and I started shooting."
- "So there were no gunshots yet? Shouldn't you first order him to stop and drop his weapon or something like this in this case?"
- "Yes, I should have, but I panicked."
- "That's understandable, but Militia men should respect the law and the rules at all times. That's why you have the training."
- "So anyway, I started blasting the bastard. I've managed to knock him out, then the second one came out and I've knocked him out too. Fortunately, their shotgun shots missed me. The third one saw that and ordered me to drop my weapon and threw a flashbang at me while someone else screamed they had a hostage. After that, I was shot in my right leg. I had to give up."
- "Third? That seems like a big, well organized group."
- "Actually, I think there were 4 robbers. I've managed to shot 2 and 5 escaped, including imprisoned 3 before."

Wounded robbers were taken to Zelenogorsk healthcare center in a critical state. Their identity is still unknown as doctors refuse access to anyone until state of the robbers is stable. In the event, 3 Militia men were shot and required medical attention. However, their wounds were very light.

### Innocent old farmer arrested for driving a red Lada

It was reported that bandits escaped Zelenogorsk in 2 red cars, Golf and Lada, towards Pogorevka. The pursuit began and Militia has created a roadblock on the road outside Zelenogorsk. They've managed to catch a farmer from Pogorevka that was driving back to his home after visiting a store in Zelenogorsk. He reported that he had his hunting rifle on a back seat. However, Militia checked his trunk and he had a mlitiary vest and flashbangs there. He was taken to the custody.

During interrogation, farmer claimed that he had mistaken his car for that one and that the bandits probably stole car that he used earlier. This was later confirmed as 2 abandoned red cars were found in Pulkovo and Pustoshka. Farmer was released shortly after and his rifle was returned to him.

### Officials are worried about increased criminal activity in western Chernarus

Both Militia commander and Chedaki Army high-command are worried about recent criminal and possibly espionage activity near Zelenogorsk. In the following days there will be attempts to use elements of Chedaki Army as a support for Militia units during regular tasks in the area.
