Some 25,000 Livonian, US, and British troops are participating in joint training operations, less than 15 km from the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.

Named Exercise Electron-39, the event will be the biggest of its kind and comes just weeks ahead of a Kremlin decision on a CSAT membership action plan.

Russia says that such a show of force, close to its borders, is a threat to its security.

Foreign Minister Poda Makarovich said: "NATO sabre-rattling is counterproductive. The world is already on a precipice."

"A return to bilateral Cold War-era thinking could be disastrous for everyone. If the US continues to ignore the new world order, and insists on creating enemies where there are none, they run the risk of making their fears a reality."
