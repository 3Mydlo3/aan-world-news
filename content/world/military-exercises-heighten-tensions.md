Some 25,000 Livonian, US, and British troops are participating in joint training operations, less than 15 km from the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.

Named Exercise Electron-39, the event will be the biggest of its kind and comes just weeks ahead of a Kremlin decision on a CSAT membership action plan.

Russia says that such a show of force, close to its borders, is a threat to its security.

Foreign Minister Poda Makarovich said: "NATO sabre-rattling is counterproductive. The world is already on a precipice."
